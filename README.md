## About this repo

This is a demo app to show how you can integrate Dialogue Wise with your [Flutter Web](https://flutter.dev/web) apps.

## Prerequisite

You will need to download and install Flutter SDK and then enable Web Support.
More info can be found [here](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/web)

## Getting Started

Once you have the Flutter SDK setup and have enabled Web support, you will need to run `flutter pub get` from within the project folder to install dependencies.

Next, to run it in dev mode run `flutter run`, and select the respective browser you want to launch from the provided list. In our case, we chose `1` for Chrome.

Once you've chosen the required browser, your app should be launched.

To build it run `flutter build web` and the files to be hosted will be generated inside the `build/web` folder. You can then copy these files to host them on any web server.
